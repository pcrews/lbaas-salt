# A sample configuration file read by the Libra utilities that use the
# Options class from the libra/common/options.py module.
#
# Options are expressed in one of two forms:
#    key = value
#    key : value
#
# Boolean options should be given either a 'true' or 'false' value.
# Some options can contain multiple values (see 'server' option in the
# [worker] section).
#
# Options given on the command line will override any options set in
# the configuration file.
########################################################################

# The [global] section contains options common to the various Libra
# utilities (worker, mgm, etc). This section is read before any other
# section, so values may be overridden by the other sections.

verbose = true

# The [worker] section is specific to the libra_worker utility.
